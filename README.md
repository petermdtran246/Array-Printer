# Array Printer
This is a simple Python program that displays an array of integers.

## Algorithm
  -  The program defines a function display() that initializes a list A with the values [1, 4, 6, 8, 10]. It then uses a for loop to iterate over the list and print each value to the console using print().
  -  The display() function is called at the end of the program to execute it.
